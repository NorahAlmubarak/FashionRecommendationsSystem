## **Motivation**
The fashion industry is a rapidly growing sector where **visual representation** of products plays a crucial role in consumer decision-making. 

We chose this dataset because:
- The fashion industry **heavily relies on AI-driven solutions** like **image classification and recommendation systems**.
- This dataset provides a **diverse set of fashion product images with metadata**, making it **ideal for machine learning models** for fashion analytics, classification, and visual search.

## **Dataset Overview**
The **Fashion Product Images Dataset** consists of **images of fashion products with metadata**, including:
- **Product categories**
- **Gender specifications**
- **Seasonality & Other attributes**

### **Key Features**
**Product Images**: A large collection of fashion product images.  
**Metadata**: Each image is labeled with attributes such as **category, sub-category, gender, season, and usage**.  
**Structured Data**: Includes **CSV files** containing **image paths and metadata**.  
**Potential Use Cases**: **Image classification, recommendation systems, and fashion analytics**.

# **Supervised Learning: Fashion Product Classification & Recommendations**
## **Goal**
We trained **supervised learning models** to **classify and recommend fashion products** based on **image features**.

## **Steps in Supervised Learning**
### **Step 1: Feature Extraction using CNN (ResNet50)**
- **Used ResNet50 (Pre-trained CNN Model)** to **extract deep image features**.
- Converted each image into a **feature vector**.

### **Step 2: Training Machine Learning Models**
We trained **two different supervised models**:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network**

### **Step 3: Model Comparison**
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- MLPClassifier (Neural Network) outperformed SVM in accuracy and recall.
-SVM had slightly better precision but was overall less effective in handling complex feature relationships.
-MLP showed stronger ability to learn deep patterns in the extracted features.

### **Step 4: Recommendation System**
1-Predict the product category of an image using MLPClassifier (Neural Network).

2-Find similar products within the same category.

3-Recommendations are based on metadata, including:
  - **Brand Name**
  - **Age Group**
  - **Gender**
  - **Base Color**
  - **Season**

4-The system suggests products that match the style, color, and category preferences.
